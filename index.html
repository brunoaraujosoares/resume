                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>
                        I am a multidisciplinary professional with a degree in Advertising,
                        a postgraduate degree in Data Analysis, and I am currently pursuing 
                        a degree in Software Engineering. </p>
                    <p>                        
                        With over 10 years of experience in web projects, I focus on creating
                        digital solutions that combine stunning user interfaces (UI), usability, user 
                        experience (UX), and accessibility.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My journey blends the creativity and understanding of human behavior
                        from advertising, the analytical rigor of data analysis, and the
                        technical depth of software engineering. This combination enables me
                        to develop products that are not only functional but also intuitive
                        and inclusive, meeting the needs of diverse users.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I am passionate about transforming ideas into memorable digital
                        experiences, always striving to align technological innovation with
                        accessible, user-centered practices.

                            The mandate's website featured a content management system (CMS). Site's content could be updated by
                            multiple users with specific access profiles. The second version 
                            incorporated SEO techniques. By January 2006, the site had over 7,000 
                            visits per month; it ranked first on Google for the search term “mandato participativo” 
                            and had a good overall position on search engines. In December 2005, I stepped away
                            from the routine activities of the Mandate, remaining in charge only of maintaining
                            the website.

                        <p>
                            I used to develop system interfaces with web-based designs. Visual planning was done
                            in Photoshop. There, I learned PHP, databases (PostgreSQL, Oracle, and MySQL),
                            strengthened my JavaScript skills, and gained some knowledge about networks. I also
                            learned how to separate code into layers. I stayed with the company for almost two
                            years, and even after leaving, I continued providing services as a freelancer.
